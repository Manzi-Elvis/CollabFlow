#  CollabFlow — Organize, Collaborate, and Flow Together  

> “Great teams don’t just work — they flow.”  

CollabFlow is a modern, interactive **team collaboration and task management platform** built with **React and Next.js**.  
I built this project to challenge myself to master frontend development — not just to make things look good, but to **design, structure, and scale** a real-world web app that feels alive, fast, and human.

##  Vision

I wanted to create something that combines the simplicity of Trello, the smoothness of Notion, and the clarity of a well-designed workflow.  
CollabFlow is my way of showing that **frontend development is not just about UI — it’s about experience, flow, and emotion**.

This project helped me dive deep into:
- Component architecture and code reusability  
- Advanced React state management (Redux Toolkit / Zustand)  
- Authentication and protected routing  
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS  
- Real-time collaboration and API integration  
- Performance optimization, accessibility, and animations

##  Core Features

-  **Authentication System** — Secure sign up, login, and logout  
-  **Dynamic Boards** — Create projects, tasks, and manage columns (To Do, Doing, Done)  
-  **Drag & Drop Tasks** — Smooth task movement powered by react-beautiful-dnd  
-  **Real-Time Collaboration** — Commenting and team updates (Socket.io or Firebase)  
-  **Analytics Dashboard** — Visualize team productivity using Recharts  
-  **Dark / Light Mode** — Because creativity works better in comfort  
-  **User Settings** — Profile management and notification control  
-  **Fully Responsive UI** — Built for desktop, tablet, and mobile
